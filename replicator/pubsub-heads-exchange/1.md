# Pubsub Heads Exchange

-----

**Abstract**

For users to collaborate on edits to databases they need to share updates. This document defines a heads exchange using the pubsub messaging pattern.

## Introduction

This replication protocol needs a pubsub interface and a way to request blocks from the network. The pubsub interface is used to communicate the latest updates with peers and then the head blocks are requested from the network. The pubsub and block networks usually used are those provided by IPFS but can be swapped out.

This document is only concerned with defining the message formats and pubsub topics used. It is not concerned with what pubsub and block networks are used.

## Design

There are two types of pubsub channels used:

  - Common Channel: a shared pubsub channel that allows peers to set up private pubsub channels
  - Direct Channel: private channel for advertising heads on update

The Common Channel is watched for peers joining and leaving, this information should be available from the pubsub network implementation. No messages need to be sent in this channel; only the ids of the peers joining and leaving. These ids will be used to create Direct Channels.

A Direct Channel is a pubsub channel unique per yours and anothers peer id. It is not unique per peer id and database meaning updates for different databases, but same peer, can use the same direct channel.

Below will document what the pubsub topics are for each channel type and Direct Channels message format.

## Common Channel Topic

The pubsub channel topic used, which is unique per database, is the database address encoded as a string with the CID encoded base32.

`/orbitdb/bafyreihd4xtkppbyyghpq55oyxu74qku4is7reffc6u5vszshl3ok5xjza`

###### [orbitdb database address spec]()

## Direct Channel Topic

This pubsub channel topic used, which is unique per the two participating peer's ids, is a string of the format `/phe/v1/<peer id 1>/<peer id 2>`. The peer ids are numbered by alphabetical order, and capitalization does not matter.

`/phe/v1/12D3KooWP2wxbEXPkcqwykrNzJEebVxnboBiGgzn8zGsXM9k63ii/12D3KooWRmv4wF6oGbZxhYyPkR9y5YX6itRwRhY6H6Ryzpscjr76`

## Direct Channel Message Format

The only message type sent in the channel is an unordered array of CIDs. There can be no limit the the array length by design. Although some pubsub implementations may limit message size, this version of the protocol specifies no way to handle this case.

The message is encoded with CBOR and sent as bytes.

## Protocol Description

#### Common Channel 

> This Common Channel is used to find peers to set up Direct Channels with

1. Join a pubsub channel with the topic matching the Common Channel Topic for the database which needs to be replicated.

2. On finding a peer over pubsub, attempt to open a Direct Channel by joining a pubsub channel with the topic matching the Direct Channel Topic for the remote and local peers.

3. When both the remote and local peers are in the pubsub channel of their corresponding Direct Channel Topic, the Direct Channel is open. Otherwise the Direct Channel is closed.

4. Peers may store their history of previously opened Direct Channels and attempt to reopen them without joining the Common Channel first.

#### Direct Channel

> The Direct Channel is used for directly sending head advertisement messages between peers

1. If the Direct Channel is closed do nothing.

2. While the Direct Channel is open, on update to the local replica's head entries send a Direct Channel Message containing the updated local replica's head entries.

3. On receiving a Direct Channel Message on an open Direct Channel:

  3.1 Verify the message was sent by the remote peer. This is sometimes handled by the pubsub implementation.

  3.2 If the set of CIDs in Direct Channel Message is identical to the local replica's set of head entry CIDs, do nothing.

  3.3 If at least one of the CIDs in the received Direct Channel Message is unknown by the local replica, pass all of the unknown CIDs in the Direct Channel Message to the local replica for traversal.

  3.4 If all of the CIDs in the Direct Channel Message are known by the local replica (and 3.2 is false) then the remote peer's replica is behind the local replica. Respond to the remote peer in the Direct Channel with a Direct Channel Message containg the local replica's head entry CIDs.
