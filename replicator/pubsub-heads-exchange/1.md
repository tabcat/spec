# Pubsub Heads Exchange

-----

**Abstract**

For users to collaborate on edits to databases they need to share updates. This document defines a heads exchange using the pubsub messaging pattern.

## Introduction

This replication protocol needs a pubsub interface and a way to request blocks from the network. The pubsub interface is used to communicate the latest updates with peers and then the head blocks are requested from the network. The pubsub and block networks usually used are those provided by IPFS but can be swapped out.

This document is only concerned with defining the message formats and pubsub topics used. It is not concerned with what pubsub and block networks are used.

## Design

There are two types of pubsub channels used:

  - Common Channel: a shared pubsub channel that allows peers to set up private pubsub channels
  - Direct Channel: private channel for advertising heads on update

The Common Channel is watched for peers joining and leaving, this information should be available from the pubsub network implementation. No messages need to be sent in this channel; only the ids of the peers joining and leaving. These ids will be used to create Direct Channels.

A Direct Channel is a pubsub channel unique per yours and anothers peer id. It is not unique per peer id and database meaning updates for different databases, but same peer, can use the same direct channel.

Below will document what the pubsub topics are for each channel type and Direct Channels message format.

## Common Channel Topic

The pubsub channel topic used, which is unique per database, is the database address encoded as a string with the CID encoded base32.

`/orbitdb/bafyreihd4xtkppbyyghpq55oyxu74qku4is7reffc6u5vszshl3ok5xjza`

###### [orbitdb database address spec]()

## Direct Channel Topic

This pubsub channel topic used, which is unique per the two participating peer's ids, is a string of the format `/phe/v1/<peer id 1>/<peer id 2>`. The peer ids are numbered by alphabetical order, and capitalization does not matter.

`/phe/v1/12d3koowbtp1acgwefsard7dbkwypar8mzr1tofwnwlfljenglwa/12D3KooWRmv4wF6oGbZxhYyPkR9y5YX6itRwRhY6H6Ryzpscjr76`

## Direct Channel Message Format

The only message type sent in the channel is an unordered array of CIDs. There can be no limit the the array length by design.
The message is encoded with CBOR and sent as bytes.

## Direct Channel Behavior

A peer should advertise its head entry CIDs, to all its peers, after they change.

When a heads advertisement is received from a peer, the CIDs in the message must be checked to see if they are ahead of behind the local replica.
If they are behind, advertise local replica's heads to the peer that advertised them.
If they are ahead, traverse the heads by requesting their blocks from the network and add all new and valid entries to the local replica. The local replica should check if the heads have changed, if so advertise them to all peers.
