# IPFS-Log Entry Version 3

-----

**Abstract**

[IPFS-Log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log) is a core part of [OrbitDB](https://orbitdb.org), it handles the operation log and provides the entry format. The format of an IPFS-Log entry is defined in this document.

## Introduction

IPFS-Log entries are used to append updates in an immutable and conflict free way. It's important to make sure the entry format is easy to transmit and verify. The spec takes advantage of binary types in CBOR to save space; and structures the data so verifying the digital signature is straightforward.

## Entry Format

An IPFS-Log Entry is a data structure, encoded using dag-cbor [[spec](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec.md)] and containing the following fields:

- **auth** (CID)
  - The creator of the entry. This is a CID pointing to the identity used to sign the entry.


- **sig** (bytes)
  - The signature from signing the data field or its hash with the identity referenced by the **auth** field.


- **data** (bytes)
  - The encapsulated entry data for easy verification of the signature.


###### see cbor [encoding specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-specification-of-the-cbor-e) and [tag 42](https://github.com/ipld/cid-cbor/)

```
  {
    auth: tag 42
    sig: type 2
    data: type 2
  }
```

#### De-encapsulate Entry Data

- **v** (uint64)
  - Denotes the version of the entry. In this case equal to `3` to denote version 3.


- **tag** (bytes)
  - The tag field is used to associate the entry with a specific log/database.


- **clock** (uint64)
  - The clock field is a logical timestamp for entries used as a part of ordering.


- **payload** (any)
  - The payload field contains the data being appended to the log. An example would be operations being appended to the database.


- **next** (CID[])
  - The next field is an array of entry CID not yet referenced by other known entries in the log, also know as log heads. Used for ordering traversal.


- **refs** (CID[])
  - The refs field is an array of entry CID, like the next field, but they reference entries farther back in the log. Used for replication, not used for ordering.


```
  {
    v: type 0
    tag: type 2
    clock: type 0
    payload: type 0-5 | tag 42
    next: type 4<tag 42>
    refs: type 4<tag 42>
  }
```

#### Example Entry:

- ###### signed entry
```
  {
    auth: CID(bafyreicl6ujc6ncfktctxxroxognfn7d2fqavvrryoc2lv6m4i6hpbkfti),
    sig: Uint8Array(70) [
       48,  68,   2,  32,  98, 244, 207, 200, 184, 243, 204,

      176, 250, 168, 189,  32, 240,  38, 193,  72, 122, 230,
       99,  18,  17,   2,  32, 124, 228,  21, 189, 116,  35,
      182, 109, 105,  83,  56, 193, 113,  34, 233,  55,  37,
      159, 119, 209, 232, 100, 148, 211,  20, 100,  54, 240,
      149, 159, 204, 198
    ],
    data: Uint8Array(77) [
      166,  97, 118,   3,  99, 116,  97, 103, 216,  42,  88,  37,
        0,   1, 113,  18,  32,  75, 245,  18,  47,  52,  69,  84,
      197,  59, 222,  46, 187, 140, 210, 183, 227, 209,  96,  10,
      214,  49, 195, 133, 165, 215, 204, 226,  60, 119, 133,  69,
      154, 100, 110, 101, 120, 116, 128, 100, 114, 101, 102, 115,
      128, 101,  99, 108, 111,  99, 107,   0, 103, 112,  97, 121,
      108, 111,  97, 100, 246
    ]
  }
```
- ###### entry data
```
  {
    v: 3,
    tag: Uint8Array(32) [
       75, 245,  18,  47,  52,  69,  84, 197,
       59, 222,  46, 187, 140, 210, 183, 227,
      209,  96,  10, 214,  49, 195, 133, 165,
      215, 204, 226,  60, 119, 133,  69, 154
    ],
    clock: 0,
    payload: null,
    next: [],
    refs: []
  }
```

The length of an encoded entry with empty payload and reference fields is ~200 bytes.

Fields that can change in length include the clock, payload, and reference fields. Each CID added to a reference field would increase the length of the entry by ~40 bytes.

## Signature Creation and Verification

The **auth** field must reference data that can be used to verify the validity of the entry. In most cases this is an [identity] with a public key.

The **sig** field must be the byte output of the DSA used to sign the **data** field with the identity referenced by the **auth** field. The identity specifies the DSA and keys being used to create and verify the **sig** field.

The **data** field must be the [dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec.md) encoded entry data in its bytes format.
